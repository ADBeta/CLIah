## Description
CLIah is a C++ Library header to allow for easy Command Line Argument parsing,  
validation and execution. Instead of manually handling the CLI arguments, define  
CLIah Arg structures and pass argv & argc.  

CLIah supports a wide range of arguments, parsing methods, and execution style:  
* Multiple argument types eg. flags, variables, strings and sub-commands.  
* Argument string, plus one additional alias string (--verbose alias -v)  
* Definable function pointers to automate execution if a CLI Argument is matched  
* Multiple unrecognised arg modes, such as Exit, Warn and Ignore  

Please see the tutorial for examples of each argument type, how to use them and  
some of the other options that can be used

## How To Use

## TO-DO 
**This is currently in alpha. Things will change rapidly and drastically**
* Variable type detection
* verbose flag internally
* debug modes?

## Version 0.2.5
